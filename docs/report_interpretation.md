# Interpreting the CIS Compliance Report

The `compliance_report.html` generated by `CIS_MACOS_15_0_MDM_Compliance.sh` summarizes compliance with 107 CIS macOS 15.0 Sequoia benchmarks. This guide explains the report’s structure and how to act on its findings.

## Report Structure
- **Header**:
  - **Hostname**: Identifies the audited device (e.g., ABCD123).
  - **Timestamp**: When the audit ran (e.g., 2025-07-15 23:58:46).
  - **Total Checks**: Number of controls audited (expected: 107; note: 117 there are still 10 controls which can only verify mannualy not included to the script).
  - **Passed/Failed/Manual**: Counts of compliant (green), non-compliant (red), and manual verification (yellow) controls.
- **Pie Chart**: Visualizes compliance distribution (requires Chart.js CDN; open in a browser).
- **Section Summary Table**:
  - Lists 10 CIS sections (e.g., Software Updates, Restrictions) with total, compliant, non-compliant, and manual counts.
  - Note: If sections show 0 counts (e.g., Restrictions with 42 controls), verify script execution or MDM profiles.
- **Detailed Sections**:
  - Each section (e.g., Security, System Access) lists controls with:
    - **Control ID**: CIS benchmark number (e.g., 2.8.24).
    - **Description**: What the control checks (e.g., “Ensure 'allowAirDrop' is not correctly configured”).
    - **Status**: Compliant, Non-Compliant, or Manual verification required.
    - **Severity**: High, Medium, Low (prioritize High).
    - **PoC**: Remediation steps, often Intune-specific (e.g., “Set 'allowAirDrop' to 0”).

## Key Findings from Sample Report
- **Compliance Rate**: 42/117 (~36%) compliant, 60 non-compliant, 15 manual.
- **High Non-Compliance**: Restrictions (32/42 non-compliant, e.g., AirDrop, iCloud) and Security (6/12, e.g., password policies) suggest MDM misconfiguration.
- **Manual Checks**: 15 controls (e.g., FileVault, Safari settings) require manual verification in Intune or system settings.
- **Discrepancy**: 117 checks vs. 107 expected; possible duplicate (e.g., 5.3/5.6 both check root account).

## How to Use the Report
1. **Prioritize Fixes**:
   - Focus on **High-severity non-compliant** controls (e.g., 2.8.17: AutoUnlock, 5.1.3: AMFI).
   - Use PoC steps (e.g., “In Intune: Set 'allowAutoUnlock' to 0”).
2. **Address Manual Checks**:
   - For FileVault (2.3.x), verify settings in Intune’s Endpoint security > Disk encryption.
   - For Safari (6.3.x), check com.apple.Safari profiles or Safari Settings.
3. **Validate Counts**:
   - If total checks ≠ 107, inspect `/var/log/cis_macos_15_0_compliance.log` for duplicates or errors.
4. **Review Logs**:
   - Check `/var/log/cis_macos_15_0_compliance.log` for details (e.g., “System check for 'defaults read ...' failed: Expected '0', Got ''”).

## Next Steps
- Follow PoCs to configure Intune settings (see `mdm_setup.md`).
- For manual checks, consult MDM console or system preferences.
- Re-run script after fixes: `sudo ./CIS_MACOS_15_0_MDM_Compliance.sh`.
